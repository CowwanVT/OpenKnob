# OpenKnob
A free and open source 3d printable volume knob

I started this project because I wanted a physical volume knob for my headphones, and I wasn't happy with any of the pre-built options I could find. 

This project makes use of two Kobiconn 161-7400-EX 3.5mm jacks and a Bourns PDB182-E420K-103A audio potentiometer, but I'm sure there are many components that will function similarly.
